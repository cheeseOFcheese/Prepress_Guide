# General Requirements for File Layouts

All submitted files must be in the **CMYK** color space.  
Accepted formats: **TIFF**, **AI**, **CDR**, **SVG**.  
Allowed formats: **PSD**, **PDF**.  
A preview file in **.JPG** must be attached for review.

## Requirements for Raster Files:
- Size: 1:1
- Color model: **CMYK**
- No alpha channels
- No paths
- Compression: **LZW**
- All layers flattened (Background)
- Fonts and effects in layers rasterized

### Optimal Resolution:
- **300 dpi** – for photos, interior printing, and objects viewed from a distance of 1-0.5 meters.
- **100-150 dpi** – for images smaller than 10 m².
- **50-75 dpi** – for large images over 10 m² (e.g., banners sized 6x3 m).

## Requirements for Vector Files:
- Size: 1:1 (preferred).
- Color model: **CMYK**.
- Scaling: Ensure that **Scale with image** is enabled for strokes.
- The layout must not contain masks, layer locks, or overlapping elements.
- Each layout should be provided as a separate file.
- Fonts must be converted to curves (we recommend attaching the font installation file).
- Linked raster images must be in the **CMYK** palette, fully embedded, or attached separately in **TIFF** format.
- All gradients, lenses, shadows, transparencies, borders, brushes, textures, etc. must be rasterized in **CMYK**.
- For layouts with a white background, add a 1-pixel black border to mark the edge.

## Additional Information:
- Total color fills should not exceed **250%** (on photo paper – **300%**).
- Black color: **C-50%, M-50%, Y-50%, K-100%**.
- Significant elements (logos, photos, etc.) should not be placed closer than 2 cm from the image edges.
- If there are specific color requirements, indicate their percentage in the **CMYK** model and **Pantone Process**.

# Digital Printing

- Formats: **TIFF**, **JPG**, **PSD**, **EPS**, **CDR**, **AI**.
- Color model: **CMYK**.
- Scale 1:1, without alpha channels, paths, or **LZW** compression.
- All layers flattened, fonts and effects rasterized.
- Recommended resolution for raster files – **300 dpi**.

**Note**: Direct printing from **AI** files is not possible due to the specifics of wide-format equipment. We recommend converting to **TIFF** and checking the result thoroughly.

# Plotter Cutting

- Formats: **PDF**, **AI**, **CDR**, **SVG**.
- Size: 1:1.
- Cutting contour: thin line (0, 100, 0, 0).
- Fonts converted to curves (font files should also be provided).
- All lines, except for the cutting contour, should be converted to objects.
- Stroke thickness: only hairline.
- Minimum size of individual elements: **4 mm** in any part.
- All objects should be closed paths for proper cutting.
