# Materials. Types

## Banner
- **Material**: The most commonly used banner is 440 g/m².
- **Roll width**: 3200 mm.
- **Print width**: 3080 mm.

### Printing recommendations:
- If the frame height is 3000 mm, the layout can be made with margins up to 3080 mm. In the technical specification, specify: "Print by roll width. Do not trim the margins of 3200 mm."
- **Types of printing**:
  - UV (interior, higher quality).
  - Solvent (exterior, lower quality, color variations may occur on different layouts).

### Layout alignment:
- When using solvent printing, if the layouts need to align on the same plane, it is important to note: "Layouts ..., ..., ... are aligned on the same plane. It's crucial that the colors do not differ."

### Banner finishing:
- If the layout is larger than 3 m, it is printed and welded from pieces.
- Usually, the seams are vertical (horizontal seams are more noticeable).
- **Common finishing**: trimming around the perimeter.
- Less common: welding (single/double for reinforcement) and eyelets spaced 500, 300, or 250 mm apart.
- Eyeleting more frequently than 250 mm is charged extra.
- **Pockets**: for pipes, etc.

### Technical requirements:
- **File format**: tiff, CMYK, 100-150 dpi.
- **Preview**: jpeg, RGB, lower resolution.
- If the banner is shaped, include a vector outline and add a 1-pixel gray border in the layout.

### Layouts for wooden frames:
- Margins around the perimeter — 150 mm.
- Cross marks in the corners of the visible area.
- Name labels in all four corners.

### Other types of banners:
- Cast 510 g/m².
- Blackback (black reverse side).
- Translucent.
- 5 m cast banner and 5 m blackback (print area — 4996 mm).

## Mesh banner
- **Roll width**: 3200 mm.
- **Print width**: 3080 mm.
- Printing can be UV or solvent.
- **Finishing**: welding and eyelets.
- **Layouts**: prepared to the frame height, 40 mm narrower in width.

## Fabric
- **Material**: The most common is ecodisplay.
- **Roll width**: 3200 mm.
- **Print width**: 3080 mm.

### Finishing:
- Trimming around the perimeter or edge stitching to prevent fraying.
- If the fabric is sewn, it’s important to specify neat seams and their location on the preview.

### Notes:
- Fabric stretches differently. At 10 m wide, it can stretch to 11 m, so it’s important not to place logos on the edges of the layouts.

## Less common materials
- **Samba**: For lightboxes.

## Films
- Three types:
  1. Removable adhesive, print width — 1200 mm, material width — about 1240 mm.
  2. Permanent adhesive, print width — 1480 mm, material width — 1500 mm.
  3. Translucent film, width — about 1000-1200 mm.

### Film finishing:
- Usually ordered with matte lamination to prevent warping during application.
- In 99% of cases, the film has a shaped contour — die cutting.

### File formats:
- Rectangular: tiff, without bleed.
- Shaped: in Illustrator or Corel, 1:1. Bottom layer — print with a 5 mm bleed, top layer — shaped contour.
- **Bleed margins**: 20 mm around the perimeter.

## Foamboard
- Sheet size and thickness need to be confirmed if required.

For standard requirements, it's important to clarify the details each time, as they may change.
